1. AAA maximum diameter, Measured in millimeter (mm), First week ( 1 studies )
1. AAA volume, Measured in cubic millimeter (mm3), First week ( 1 studies )
1. AF termination, conversion to sinus rhythm or stable atrial tachycardia, during the ablation procedure ( 1 studies )
1. Accuracy of the CADp system, accuracy with which the CADp system predicts completeness of polypectomy in the test set with the reference standard for completeness being determined by the histology of post-polypectomy margin biopsies; if free from any polyp tissue (adenomatous, serrated or hyperplastic), the resection will be considered complete. If remnant polyp tissue is detected in any one or more of the margin biopsies the resection is deemed incomplete, 3 weeks ( 1 studies )
1. Adenoma Per Extraction (APE)., Non inferiority of Ultivision-AI arm versus control arm. Where APE is the fraction of adenoma, sessile serrated lesions, and large (\>10mm) hyperplastic polyps of the proximal colon (caecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, and transverse colon) out of total number of resections., During the procedure/surgery ( 1 studies )
1. Adenoma per Colonoscopy (APC), Superiority of Ultivision-AI arm versus control arm. APC is defined as the total number of histologically confirmed adenomas resected divided by the total number of colonoscopies., During the procedure/surgery ( 1 studies )
1. Average Number of Adenomas Per Colonoscopy, Average Number of Adenomas Per Colonoscopy for all study subjects undergoing colonoscopy procedures, separately calculated for each of the study arms., Receipt of pathology results for procedure findings (typically within 2 weeks after the procedure) ( 1 studies )
1. Average Number of Adenomas Per Extraction, Percent of extractions that are adenomas per Colonoscopy for all study subjects undergoing colonoscopy procedures, separately calculated for each of the study arms., Receipt of pathology results for procedure findings (typically within 2 weeks after the procedure) ( 1 studies )
1. Average session time when using the mobile app, Over the 5 weeks of the study, the mobile app will collect time (seconds) the user spends within each session. We will calculate the average time the user spent on mobile app in each session., 5 weeks ( 1 studies )
1. B-Line count CardioMEMS comparison, Relationship comparisons between ultrasound data from exams performed by heart failure patients using the study app (both in clinic and at home) and ultrasound exams performed by novice clinicians to pulmonary pressure data from the Abbott CardioMEMS system, Study Completion (91 days) ( 1 studies )
1. COVID 19 Detection, Determine the safety and feasibility of the POC AI-ECG's ability to detect active SARS-Cov-2 infection in humans., One time screening within 4 hours of PCR test ( 1 studies )
1. Capture of incidentally identified lung nodules utilizing the electronic medical record, To capture all incidentally identified lung nodules and create a multidisciplinary team for lung nodule management. Radiology and pulmonary providers will identify and report IPNs \>=6mm denoted as positive imaging result at Montefiore. NLP will be used to identify IPNs using the Lung Orchestrator and IPNs will be captured by automated assessment of radiology. Cardiothoracic Imaging will assist in nodule identification using NLP. Following confirmation of a nodule requiring follow-up, the Lung Orchestrator will place the patient in a work queue. Patients diagnosed with lung cancer the year prior to the program will be reviewed retrospectively with NLP for determination on whether the approach increases adherence to IPN follow-up guidelines., Through completion of chart review, up to 1 year ( 1 studies )
1. Change in ADHD severity (ASRS), Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS). Increase in score dictates increase in ADHD symptom severity. Scale of 0-5 on each question., weeks 0, 3, 6, follow-up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months ( 1 studies )
1. Change in Parent Rated Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2) from baseline to week 4, The Social Responsiveness Scale-2 is a 65-item measure where parents rate their child selecting responses on a Likert Scale. This measure will be used to measure and identify social impairment associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and to quantify its severitySocial Responsiveness Scale (SRS) raw scores measure social abilities with lower scores indicating better social skills. (Raw Score Range: 0 - 195 and T-Score Range: 37- above 90)., Baseline (Week 0), Week 4 ( 1 studies )
1. Change in Short term impact on anxiety as assessed by the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, The GAD-7 is a self-administered 7 item instrument that uses some of the DSM-V criteria for anxiety to identify probable cases of GAD along with measuring anxiety symptom severity. Responders are asked to rate the frequency of anxiety symptoms in the last 2 weeks on a Likert scale ranging from 0-3.Severity can be determined by examining the total score. A meaningful change is 5 or more points., Baseline, 5 weeks ( 1 studies )
