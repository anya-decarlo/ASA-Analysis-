"46","Capture of incidentally identified lung nodules utilizing the electronic medical record, To capture all incidentally identified lung nodules and create a multidisciplinary team for lung nodule management. Radiology and pulmonary providers will identify and report IPNs \>=6mm denoted as positive imaging result at Montefiore. NLP will be used to identify IPNs using the Lung Orchestrator and IPNs will be captured by automated assessment of radiology. Cardiothoracic Imaging will assist in nodule identification using NLP. Following confirmation of a nodule requiring follow-up, the Lung Orchestrator will place the patient in a work queue. Patients diagnosed with lung cancer the year prior to the program will be reviewed retrospectively with NLP for determination on whether the approach increases adherence to IPN follow-up guidelines., Through completion of chart review, up to 1 year|Performance comparison of EMR-based algorithm to establish risk, Patients will be followed to develop a multi-component integrated risk classifier for stratification into low or intermediate malignancy risk. Risk calculators (Brock University; Mayo Clinic) will be used for assessment and evaluations designed to automatically populate in the EMR. Stratification will be based upon demographic factors, such as age, gender, race, smoking, and cancer history. Imaging characteristics such as emphysema, nodule location, size, and concerning features will be used. The aim is to develop an automated risk calculating algorithm based upon AI-mediated processing of clinical data and radiomics. These assessments will allow for real-time risk identification and the investigation of a novel model will incorporate data from a more diverse population., Through development of algorithm, up to 1 year|Evaluation of LiquidLung plasma-based gene expression assay for biomarker subset selection using biobanked specimens, This assay is applicable for all concerning pulmonary nodules, represented by those patients referred to the lung nodule clinic.
